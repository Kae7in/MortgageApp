/**
 The Amortization class is fairly synonymous with the terms "period" or "month".
 It represents a single period in the payment schedule of a mortgage. The properties
 of the Amortization object reflect the state they're in at the time this period occurs.
 
 The properties on this object are useful when comparing what this month would have been
 like had the user not made any extra payments.
 
 For a 30 year mortgage, there are 360 of these objects in the Mortgage's payment schedule.
